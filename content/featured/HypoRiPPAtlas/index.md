HypoRiPPAtlas is an Atlas of hypothetical natural products for mass spectrometry database search, bridging the gap between large-scale genome mining and mass spectral datasets. In this study, we identified RiPPs in microbes and plants, paving the way for large-scale explorations of biosynthetic pathways and chemical structures of microbial and plant RiPP classes.
