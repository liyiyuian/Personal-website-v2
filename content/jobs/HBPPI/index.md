- Numerous computational methods have been developed for intra-species protein-protein interaction prediction, but inter-species predictions are limited in terms of number of publications, scope of species, and mechanisms.

- Traditionally, protein-protein interaction prediction relies on homology, sequence/domain/structural similarities to known PPIs. However, deep neural networks offer a different approach to identify the underlying features that suggest PPIs.

- In this project, I developed a computational pipeline to systematically screen the combinations of human and gut microbiome proteins for potential PPIs.
