- The rapid development of sequencing and mass spectrometry technologies has enabled the full power of big data analysis. Genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, phospho-proteomic, and metabolomic data are all rapidly expanding, each containing valuable information for researchers. But what about the interactions between different "omics"?

- Can we view the central dogma as a sequential projection of omics data? For example, considering the transcriptome as a projection of the genome, the proteome as a projection of the transcriptome, and the metabolome as a projection of the proteome.

- Macrophages play a critical role in moderating immunological homeostasis in the gut. However, how they respond to various bacterial species is unknown. We aim to answer this question using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to capture subtle dynamics in transcriptional levels.
