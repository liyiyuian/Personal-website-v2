- In addition to my role as a researcher trainee, I am passionate about sharing my experiences in my career transition from biochemist to computational biologist, and introducing computational biology papers to biologists. This allows me to combine my love of research with my desire to communicate scientific concepts to others. I believe that by sharing my experiences and introducing relevant papers, I can help bridge the gap between experimental and computational biology, and foster a deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of modern biology.
- My blog will focus on several key topics, including:
  - Paper reviews in computational biology and deep learning: I will provide critical reviews of influential papers in these fields, highlighting their key contributions, methodologies, and implications for future research. By analyzing and discussing these papers, I aim to help readers deepen their understanding of the cutting-edge techniques and concepts shaping the fields of computational biology and deep learning.
  - My experience in changing academic focus: I will discuss my personal journey of transitioning from a biochemist to a computational biologist, sharing the challenges I faced, the skills I had to acquire, and the lessons I learned along the way.
  - Development environment setup: I will share my experiences and insights on setting up an effective development environment, including tips and tricks for optimizing productivity and efficiency.
